# Sumo 2018
### Instructions
Move the sumo folder wherever you like, but do not rename the folder or the file inside.
You can freely edit the contents of sumo.ino however you like.

In the Arduino IDE, click on __Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library__ 
and add the *SparkFun_TB6612FNG_Arduino_Library-master.zip* from this repository.  This is required for
the sumo.ino file to compile successfully.
